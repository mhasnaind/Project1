## **Project objective**

Evaluation of tradition Investment valuation and Risk assessment models and strategies of Financial Institutions
1) Do historical evaluation and risk management models need to evolve? 
2) Understanding how social media is influencing stock prices 


## **Understanding the problem**

1) The need for financial institutions to modernize their investment and risk management strategies and systems to factor in social Influences

2) How much can social media impact financial activity 

3) What would have been the original forecasted stock price be before the influences of social media

## **Overview**

In what seems like a modern day twist to the Robin Hood story — a gaming company stocks had become a battleground between the rich and the poor with Reddit users attempting to bankrupt hedge fund managers.

"US company GameStop is a brick-and-mortar video game retailer that has been struggling with profits due to store closures, decline in physical sales and the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, a short squeeze resulted in a 1,500% increase in GameStop's share price over the course of two weeks, reaching an all-time intraday high of US$483.00 as of 29th January 2021, on the New York Stock Exchange

This effect was mainly attributed to a coordinated effort by the Reddit community r/wallstreetbets, a subreddit dedicated to stocks with high market risk. A surge in the stock price in extended-hours trading occurred after Elon Musk made a post on Twitter that included "Gamestonk!" (in reference to r/wallstreetbets) and a link to the community.


##  **Our Process** 

Financial stock price data analysis:
Impact on stock price, financial returns and volatility
Pre and post volatility MonteCarlo simulation 
Social media mentions on GME:
Data on GME Twitter  mentions from Sproutsocial
Google data analytics
Intended to use Reddit API for data analysis
Correlation between GME stockprice changes vs increase in Gamestock mentions / conversation


## **Financial returns metrics**

Mean returns 2017 -20: - 0.005%
Mean returns 2018-21: 0.008%
MonteCarlo Simulation 1:
Mean = 0.023
Std = 0.07

MonteCarlo Simulation 2:
Mean = 1.72e+08
Std = 2.52e+09

## **Data on social media mentions**

Example: January 20 - 27 2021
82000 Reddit mentions of GME,  1.5m tweets, 1,465 Youtube videos
All combined, these had a potential reach of 10 billion impressions and generated 12.8 million likes and shares
2,805% increase in topic volume
3,041% increase in potential reach
4,521% increase in social engagements


## **Our Findings**

-Financial data was clearly impacted
-MonteCarlo simulation pre and post volatility data models wildly different returns
-Correlation of social media discussion vs stock price
-Absence of social media metrics in stock price analysis will affect the risk and valuation of stocks


## **Conclusions**

-Traditional risk and valuation models and metrics haven’t evolved with time
-New investment platforms available for eg Robinhood providing investment access to a wider group of people
-Influenced by new forms of ‘media’ such as Reddit / Twitter etc
-Various channels of information beyond Bloomberg, News channels etc
-New data suggests non financial data and related social metrics need to be incorporated in investment risk and valuation models for listed organisations
-Use machine learning for non-financial data to better understand sentiment and how it affects stock prices
